# Collection Storefront
<!-- TODO: write what the purpose of this repo is -->

## Configuration

<!-- TODO: explain why this is configurable and how -->
### Contract Configuration
These values can be found under the `Developer` tab of your contract in the [HyperMint Dashboard](https://app.hypermint.com/)

### Theme Configuration

### Content Configuration
This will configure the title and description of the collection, as well as the site metadata used by crawlers to display the site on search engines.

> ⚠️ This project is not server side rendered so is not optimised for SEO. It is also worth noting the title and description meta only gets loaded after JavaScript is injected into the page so to get more reliable results across different search enginers it is best to also edit `index.html` with static metadata.
